# Lower Limbs Activity Recognition using Machine Learning Method

This project aims to classify the 3 common lower limbs activities (with both left and right side) of osteoarthritis rehabilitation with 3axes' accelerometers ang gyroscopes. The machine learning models are used to classification.

#### Lower limbs activity
  * right-side Straight Leg Raise (SLR-R)
  * left-side Straight Leg Raise (SLR-L)
  * right-side Short-arc Exercise (SAE-R)
  * left-side Short-arc Exercise (SAE-L)
  * right-side Snee Extension (KE-R)
  * left-side Snee Extension (KE-L)
