# Lower Limbs Activity Recognition using Machine Learning Method

This project aims to classify the 3 common lower limbs activities (with both left and right side) of osteoarthritis rehabilitation with 3axes' accelerometers ang gyroscopes. The machine learning models are used to classification.

###### Lower limbs activity
  * right-side straight leg raise (SLR-R)
  * left-side straight leg raise (SLR-L)
  * right-side short-arc exercise (SAE-R)
  * left-side short-arc exercise (SAE-L)
  * right-side knee extension (KE-R)
  * left-side knee extension (KE-L)
