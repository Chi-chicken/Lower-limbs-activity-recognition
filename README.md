# Lower Limbs Activity Recognition using Machine Learning Methods

This project aims to classify the 3 common lower limbs activities (with both left and right side) of osteoarthritis rehabilitation with 3axes' accelerometers ang gyroscopes. The machine learning models are used to classification.

### Lower limbs activity
  * right-side Straight Leg Raise (SLR-R)
  * left-side Straight Leg Raise (SLR-L)
  * right-side Short-arc Exercise (SAE-R)
  * left-side Short-arc Exercise (SAE-L)
  * right-side Snee Extension (KE-R)
  * left-side Snee Extension (KE-L)

### Sensors
 * 6 OPAL IMUs (published by APDM, Portland, USA)
 * Sampling rate: 128 Hz
 * Sensors(6) location:  Chest, waist, both thighs, and both shanks

## Methods
